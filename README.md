# Manos - Charity Management System

Manos is a web-based charity management system that allows donors and recipients to interact with the platform. The system helps donors contribute to various causes, while recipients can apply for assistance through dedicated forms. The project is built using Spring Boot for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It is connected to a MySQL database called manos_db for storing data.
